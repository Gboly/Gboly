Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer with frontend and backend experience. I use React for my frontend projects and node.js together with express for my backend services.

- I'm currently working on a fullstack social media web app, CHOCHOCHO. 
- I'm open to great internships or junior developer roles. 
- I am currently learning unit testing using JestðŸ˜€. 
- I'm also really interested in open source which made me join Eddie's hub here on github. They have good repos for contribution.
