                <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
                <p class="html-css">I started my web development journey sometime last year when i enrolled for a related course on Udemy by Manzoor Ahmed, it was a free course so i was not convinced i was going to be taught all that is needed which made me enroll for Angela's course. The combination of these courses have really helped in giving me a strong foundation in web development. </p>

                <h3>AutoCAD</h3>
                <p class="autocad">Funny how i've always known about AutoCAD since my first year in the university but i just wouldn't learn it even when i knew it was a neccesary software that i need in my field of study. i just knew i would learn it one way or the other and fortunately for me, i got an internship at a reputable engineering firm in my 400L where AutoCAD is the air they breath. I knew there was no escaping this. Now, i'm great at drafting in autoCAD but not yet in designing proper.</p>
